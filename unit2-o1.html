                <i>"Copyright refers to the legal protection of original works of authorship. This includes literary, written, dramatic, artistic, musical, and other types of creative expression."</i>
                <br><br>
                Written material, graphics, business logos, and other visual and sound elements, are firmly categorised as copyrightable material.
                <br><br>
                <i>"The law in the U.K. is the 'Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988'. It is similar to the U.S. law in that it protects original creations involving literary work, music, art, film, and sound. A supplemental law, the 'Copyright (Computer Programs) Regulations 1992' extends protection to software, which is normally protected under laws and agencies unique from copyright.
                Works are protected upon creation, meaning as soon as you post your website, you enjoy copyright protection. However, the U.K. Copyright Service highly recommends registration because websites are subject to abuse and that process allows a civil cause of action.
                The U.K. law does not extend the same copyright protection to logos as the U.S. law. You will have to register any logos as a trademark."</i> <br><br>
                
                Constraits which a developer could face when building a website would entail rights to usage over content, on reusing text or images, needing to  reference the creator of content, etc.

                    account - describe issues that people with
                    disabilities may face when using webpages and
                    how we can overcome them.</p>
                <p class="p-home"><br><br>
                    When it comes to accessibility with digital project or webpages it is important to take into consideration the issues all people will face whilst using them. We do not want to be producing ableist websites or digital products which could alienate someone with disabilities. It is important to think "disability first". 
                    <br><br>
                    - Designing and including elements which are picked up by text-speech or other AT applications: These will help someone with visual impairment to better understand the website. <br>
                    - Use of the 'Alt' tag on images: Will inform someone about what a link does when clicked. <br>
                    - Colour palette changes or good colour palette choices: Keeping contrast, colour choice and balance within the site to prevent over stimulus or distraction.<br>
                    - Simplistic designs which aren't overcrowded: Keep it simple so its easy to understand.<br>
                    - Strong heading structure: Using a proper hierarchy so that it is easy to discern the website. <br>
                    - Use of sound signifies: Will help someone to know when things are loading, have been clicked or there is general progress or activity within the website. <br>
                    - Ensure you know who you are building/designing for: It can be hard to design for all disabilities, as some with conflict with others, so being fully aware of who will be accessing your website is important. Alternatively offering other ways to view the site, for example, "dark and light mode" which could change the colour palette for people with autism to more muted etc.
