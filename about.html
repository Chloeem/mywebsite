                Hello, I'm Chloë Emily Stokes. A self-taught Graphic Designer, and student Junior Developer. Before COVID-19 hit, I was self-employed as a creative and
                working as a
                chef in a vegan restaurant, whilst following autodidact study of programming in HTML/CSS/JS.
                <br>
                <br>
                I aim to progress to full-stack development so that I can offer digital architecture from the
                ground up and be location independent again. The dream would be to split my workload between
                sustainable/eco corporate work with a human-focused approach and building for NGO's or grass-roots ventures alongside.
                <br><br>
                Get into coding for me was like a light bulb moment. I'd resisted for a long time, truly believing that I would be able to get my head into it because of my mind generally functioning in a non-linear way. I'd dabbled with HTML/CSS as a kid on Myspace and other social media platforms, but never anything more than that. I've always had a way with computers, spending much of my childhood playing around on the command line, occupied for hours with text-based gaming, playing The Sims, or drawing on paint.<br><br>
                I'd always presumed I would become a developer when I was older, but my path took a longer route to get here - finding out I had ADHD a few years back caused me to reassess the challenges in my life, break down the stigma which shadows this diagnosis, and to get properly in touch with how I learn or engage with the world around me. A year ago I decided to finally take the plunge with learning to code, only to find it was the most addictive and rewarding past time for my ADHD. It has helped me to see the power held within my neurodivergent mind. The superpower that is hyperfocus, along with how highly adaptable I am and my amazing problem-solving skills (to name a few advantages). <br><br>

                I hope one day to be able to extend that experience out to others who are doubting themselves or feel becoming a developer is inaccessible. It is so important for all of us to have key role models to look to who are paving an aspirational footpath and breaking stereotypes. <br><br>
                My ultimate goal is to be able to travel to anywhere in the world and offer my help or teachings to people in need. I want to use my privileged position to learn as much as possible, and help make a positive change in the world.
