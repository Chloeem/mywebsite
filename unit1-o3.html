                    In terms of productivity and efficiency the IT tools and systems I used, we're generally helpful. I would say the biggest drawback was trying to assimilate numerous new tools/systems all at once. This didn't allow for a seamless project as the use of these tools was not second nature, and did still involve learning. Personally, I feel I could have been more efficient with this project if I had the full amount of time to produce the work and without the personal worry and stress with my circumstance. Also producing this work remotely does make a big difference to workflow - there is a lot to be said for bouncing your ideas off peers face to face, and navigating a project within a work environment instead of in your own home.  However, this being said I enjoyed using the tools and systems specified and will be bringing them into all my future projects.

                    - Better planning of time - breaking down all elements of the project at the project inception, figuring out exactly what will be achieved each day and allowing properly for breaks or timeout from the project.<br>
                    - Brainstorming - confidently getting all initial ideas now and allowing myself the time to run with a few of them before settling on a final idea.<br>
                    - Having a workspace - Having a workspace outside of my bedroom so that I can properly be within a work mode whilst sat at my computer.

                    Given the nature of me having ADHD, I have to ensure that I do not have too many distractions around me. Overly I have got this managed well, but I know there are applications out there which I could use to better aid my attention and motivation when it starts to wain. Feedback off peers would be a big one for me, I find being able the bounce ideas off my peers helps my productivity and inspiration. I could have attempted to do so through Slack or Zoom.

                    To test these digital solutions I would do so in a non-deadline environment, gradually adding each into my work repertoire and keeping notes on how successful I feel they are at various given moments. The digital solutions which are the most successful I would bring into all future projects.

                    In today's modern society the ubiquitous nature of technology has become deeply
                    apparent for all.
                    There is no escaping the need for full immersion into an I.T. driven business if you
                    want success in
                    2020.
