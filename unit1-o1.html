                <p class="p-home"><br><br>
                    In today's modern society the ubiquitous nature of technology has become deeply apparent for all.
                    There is no escaping the need for full immersion into an I.T. driven business if you want success in
                    2020. From the ground up a digital presence can offer a business the opportunity for greater growth
                    and customer satisfaction. Increasing contact points, accessibility for all, automation, tracking,
                    reduction of physical assets reducing carbon footprint, direct sales, networking, creating a
                    community, building a firm brand identity which creates stronger brand loyalty and sense of
                    belonging; to name a few.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For business within 2020 I.T. should serve the purpose of building the backbone of the company. For
                    example, a freelance web developer could build their portfolio website using Vscode,
                    HTML/CSS/Javascript/Node.js etc, use Pinterest to research inspirations and create a board to show
                    this, using Sketch to create wireframes for UI flow, have a Linkedin profile for networking and job
                    sourcing purposes or a senses of community with the field, use an API to link up email and contact services, perhaps send out a monthly
                    create a mailing list, and yse Google drive to has access to all work from from cloud on any device, etc.

                    needed to complete digital projects successfully.</p>
                <p class="p-home"><br><br>
                    To ensure a project is successful in its completion, it's all about staying ahead of the game with
                    your time and project management. If you can predict outcomes, by working to this schedule, it is
                    easier to produce a project which fulfils the brief. Each person will have a different set of key
                    skills which they can bring to to the table, however some important ones to aim for are:
                    <br><br>
                    - Knowledge: On the topic at hand.<br>
                    - Confidence: In your capabilities.<br>
                    - Organisation: Project management.<br>
                    - Efficiency: Time management.<br>
                    - Decision making: Being decisive. <br>
                    - Creativity: Ability the think freely and express yourself.
                    <br><br>
                    Along with personal skills, it is of importance to have the right
                    software/applications/programmes/hardware/internet, so that you can get the job done. For example
                    building a website you would need knowledge in HTML/CSS, Vscode, Github, Trello, Slack, Google,
                    Pinterest, wireframes, colour theory, UI, UX, project management, Grammarly or Word or Pages, etc.

                <p class="p-home"><br><br>
                    I will plan out my project using Trello (link to board in to right hand corner) and the Kanban
                    method to
                    track all necessary elements. Using a label system to highlight what is classified as written work,
                    project management, HTML, CSS, Python. I will add in the description for each card, a checklist to
                    work through to completion whilst it is within the doing list, and any attachments which have been
                    used or will aid the process.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Stage 1:</b>
                    <i>Research</i><br><br>
                    I will keep track of all steps with my Trello board using the Kanban method, using checklists for
                    each unit and stage of the project.
                    Design: Using Pinterest I will create a board of website design inspirations/colour palettes/font
                    combinations. I will sketch out initial ideas for the layout, then create wireframes from this using
                    the MockFlow WireframePro Power-up within Trello, to ensure good UI flow and UX within the website.
                    Learning: I will use a search engine to learn more about the way to add an extra creative flair to
                    my website using code.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Stage 2:</b>
                    <i>Preparation</i><br><br>
                    Written section: I will write out all written work using the Grammarly app to ensure no spelling or
                    grammar mistakes, and all the website copy is finalised before adding to the site.
                    Images: I will select and adjust any images I wish to add to the website, including any links to
                    creators work if online assets are used off Upsplash or any other asset site.
                    Colour palette: I will select a colour palette based on my previous research.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Stage 3:</b>
                    <i>Creation</i><br><br>
                    HTML: I will create the backbone of the website in HTML, including all copy, images, videos, links
                    etc.
                    CSS: Using CSS I will create the aesthetic for the website, making sure to utilise the wireframes
                    create earlier to maximise UX (User Experience) flow and user satisfaction.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Stage 4:</b>
                    <i>Testing</i><br><br>
                    Running tests: I will run some user testing to ensure all buttons, links and general use of the
                    website is correct showing no errors or glitches.

                    When producing a digital project it is beneficial to consider any possible setbacks you could
                    face along the way, unique to the digital experience.
                    <br><br>
                    - Software failures: Resulting in the loss of work, you could combat this by saving work in the
                    cloud as a duplicate.<br><br>
                    - Accessible internet: Can you get online? Without internet access, you may not be able to use
                    the software or applications you need to create the digital project or get it back off the
                    cloud.<br><br>
                    - Hardware issues: Laptop or computer breakage, preventing a person from continuing with their
                    work or downloading the files.<br><br>
                    - Malware or viruses: Invasion of your digital space by these could cause several issues with
                    your system, or result in leaked work to competitors.

                    Selecting the correct software and IT systems for the job would be dependent on the job at hand. For

                <p class="p-home"><br><br>
                    Trello has been extremely effective at visualising a project in an easily digestible way. Especially
                    using the Kanban method, so that you can track the progress of each stage seamlessly. Whilst coding
                    linking this up to a Github account, using version control to only allow edits to a branch whilst in
                    the initial building process. Version control ensures only checked code is pulled to the master
                    branch, preventing bugs and errors. If you are working within a team it also allows a senior
                    developer to access your pushed code within your Github and check over it before pulling to the
                    master. These two forms, tracking progress and how the code is built, allow for the project to come
                    together bit by bit, amassing up to the whole. Without this staging, the project could be faced with
                    easily preventable challenges which have a knock-on effect with timing and deadlines.

                    impact digital projects.</p>
                <p class="p-home"><br><br>
                    We now live in a data-driven age, so with this, it seems only natural that legislation would be brought in place to ensure the safe use of that important data. In May 2018 the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) was brought into effect, to support this new need. 
                    <br><br>
                    <i>"GDPR legislation around data privacy and protection was adopted in April 2016 - and will officially be enforced from 25th May 2018, building on the 1995 data protection directive and modernising data regulation to reflect how businesses use and collect data today."</i>
                    <br><br>
                    <i>"Essentially, GDPR is about standardising (currently mixed) EU data directives, to provide best practice regulations on data handling and compliance. Designed to strengthen then individual’s rights and create better transparency and control, it will ensure web users are aware of (and can control) the personal data they share with companies."<i>
                    <br><br>
                    <i>"6 top-level areas that GDPR covers are:<br>
                    - Right to access: Under GDPR, data controllers (companies that hold personal data) must be able to provide (for free) a copy of an individual’s data if requested. Individuals may find out what personal data of theirs is being processed, where and why. <br>
                    - Right to erasure: The ‘right to be forgotten’ allows individuals to request that a data controller deletes their personal data; preventing them and related third parties from accessing or processing their information. <br>
                    - Data portability: Under GDPR, individuals will be able to request access to their data ‘in an electronic format’, which they can transfer to another data controller (such as when switching service providers). <br>
                    - Data breach notification: This means customers and data controllers must be notified of data breaches (leaks, hacks, or lost data - such as information on a lost USB stick) within 72 hours.<br>
                    - Privacy by design: Data compliance and data protection must now be considered from the start when designing new systems. Organisational and technical processes must be considered to ensure personal data is secure and that only data that is ‘absolutely necessary for the completion of duties’ is held. <br>
                    - Data protection officers: Public companies, or companies whose main activities involve data processing and monitoring will now need to appoint a data protection officer rather than notifying local Data Protection Authorities of their activities."</i>
